# Adventure Game

This is a simple adventure game where the player can move around a map and interact with the environment. The game is written in JavaScript and uses HTML and CSS for the user interface.

## How to Play
To play the game, open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will start and you will see a map of the game world, as well as a text box where you can enter commands.

The available commands are:

*move north: Move the player character north on the map.
*move south: Move the player character south on the map.
*move east: Move the player character east on the map.
*move west: Move the player character west on the map.
look: Display a description of the current location.
Enter one of these commands in the text box and press Enter to execute it. The game will respond with a message telling you what happened, and the map will be updated to show your new location.

## Game Mechanics
The game takes place on a grid-based map made up of emoji symbols. The player character is represented by a smiley face (ðŸ˜€) and can move around the map by entering one of the four movement commands.

As you move around the map, you will encounter different types of terrain, represented by different emoji symbols. Each type of terrain has a different description that will be displayed when you use the look command.
